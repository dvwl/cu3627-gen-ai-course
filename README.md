## Overview

This repository contains course materials, exercises, and resources for the **GitHub Copilot & Generative AI for Developers (CU3627)** technical training course by DreamCatcher Consulting Sdn Bhd.  
The course introduces **AI-assisted development workflows**, demonstrates **GitHub Copilot** in Visual Studio Code, and provides hands-on labs in C#/.NET.

**Course Provider**: SBL-Khas 10001585903 (Exp: 08/08/2026)  
**Duration**: 1 day (9am – 5pm)

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

- Understand how Generative AI supports developers in real-world coding tasks
- Install, configure, and work with GitHub Copilot in VS Code
- Apply prompt mechanics effectively (comments, inline, ghost suggestions)
- Explore AI-powered utilities, stubs, and code generation
- Learn best practices for first use and ethical AI coding
- Build small .NET apps using Copilot for practical coding scenarios

## 📚 Course Structure

### Module 1: Effective Prompting & Practical Scenarios in C# (3 hours)
Learn how to craft prompts that guide Copilot effectively in C#. Practice with OOP design, LINQ, collections, exception handling, unit testing, and multi-file context (MCP-style prompts). This module includes short, interleaved labs to build prompting fluency.

### Module 2: Build Challenge — Your Copilot-assisted Feature (3 hours)
Work with a partially completed C# console app (Task Manager / Inventory / Data Parser). Use Copilot to complete features, add validation, implement file-based logging, write NUnit tests, and generate project documentation (XML comments + README). Conclude with sharing and discussion of prompting strategies.

## 🛠️ Tools and Resources

- **Visual Studio Code** with GitHub Copilot extension
- **.NET 10 SDK** for demo and lab projects
- Example boilerplate code in `demos/` and `exercises/`
