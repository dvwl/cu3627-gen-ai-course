# Data Parser (Half-baked Demo)

This is a starter C# console app for parsing CSV files. Learners should enhance this app using GenAI and Copilot.

## Features
- Parse CSV and display results (basic implementation)

## Enhancement Ideas
- Add error handling
- Add logging
- Add unit tests
- Refactor for extensibility
- Stretch: ASP.NET version, support more formats, save results to database

## How to Run
```sh
dotnet run
```

Use Copilot to generate the final README and improve this project!
